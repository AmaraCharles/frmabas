                                <p>
                                    1.1 This client agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered by and
                                    between Calpinetrade (the “Company”) and the person and/or legal entity
                                    that has applied to open a trading account at the Company’s Binary Options trading
                                    platform (the “Client”), according to the terms and conditions detailed in this
                                    agreement.</p>
                                <p>
                                    1.2 Trading in Binary Options (“Trading”), means that a contract is being created
                                    which gives the Client the right to estimate the direction of change in price of an
                                    underlying asset, within a certain time frame determined by the Company. This
                                    trading instrument is different from trading in trading in ‘options’ in a
                                    traditional way, since there is a fixed return that is determined at the outset of
                                    the trade, such as: there is usually no Stop-Loss order and other features.
                                <p>
                                <hr/>
                                <h4>2. The Trading Account</h4>

                                <p>
                                    2.1 Account Opening – Client may apply for an account through the Company’s website
                                    and the Company will accept such account opening application (the “Trading Account”)
                                    under the following terms: <br/>(i) the Company has received confirmation that the Client
                                    has agreed to enter into this Agreement (such confirmation can be made by checking
                                    the “I AGREE” button or link on the Company’s Internet website (the “Website”),
                                    followed by a completed application form (if applicable) and all other Client’s
                                    information required by the Company to be provided. The Client confirms that
                                    Client’s information is full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in the
                                    information provided by the Client, the Client must notify the Company immediately
                                    of any such change.</p>
                                <p>
                                    2.2 Usage of the Trading Platform is done through the Account, by a limited license
                                    provided by the Company to the Client. The license is personal, non-transferable and
                                    is for persons who are older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law
                                    applicable to the Client’s jurisdictions requires a higher legal age) and subject to
                                    this Agreement. The Client will not transfer, assign, or enable other to make any
                                    use of the license, and/or give the Clients access codes to the Trading Account to
                                    anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third party due to
                                    breach of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client’s sole
                                    responsibility.</p>
                                <p>
                                    2.3 Activation of the Trading Account – The Account will be activated by the Company
                                    as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the
                                    Trading Account. The Company may activate the Trading Account and permit trading in
                                    the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and to the satisfaction of such
                                    further requirements as the Company may impose. Where a Trading Account is not
                                    activated or is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading
                                    Account may be transferred back or to any other person until the Company is
                                    satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied with.</p>

                                <p>
                                    2.4 The Company may act, according to the Company’s sole discretion, as principal or
                                    as agent on the Client’s behalf in relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant
                                    to the Agreement. Therefore the Company may act as the counter party to the Clients
                                    Trading activity. The Client confirms that it acts as the sole principal and not as
                                    agent or trustee on behalf of someone else.</p>

                                <p>2.5 The Client hereby represents and warrants that his engagement with the Company in
                                    this Agreement and his use of the Company’s services are in full compliance with the
                                    law applicable to the Client.</p>

                                <h4>3. The Transactions</h4>

                                <p>3.1 The Trading Platform enables Binary Options trading in exchange rates of
                                    different currencies, commodities, and any other financial instruments made
                                    available by the Company. The Trading Platform displays indicative quotes of
                                    exchange rates of different financial instruments pairs, based on different
                                    financial information systems, as the most updated exchange rates in the
                                    international capital markets. For determining the quotes for different time
                                    periods, the platform is making mathematical calculations according to known and
                                    accepted capital markets formulas. It is acknowledged by both Parties that due to
                                    different calculation methods and other circumstances, different trading platforms
                                    and/or markets may display different price quotes.
                                </p>

                                <p>3.2 The Client will receive a predetermined pay-out if his binary option transaction
                                    expires in-the-money, and he will lose a predetermined amount of his investment in
                                    the Transaction if the option expires out-of-the-money. The predetermined amounts
                                    are a derivative of the collateral invested in the transaction by the Client, and
                                    will be published in the Trading Platform. The degree to which the option is
                                    in-the-money or out-of-the-money does not matter as it does with a traditional
                                    options
                                </p>

                                <p>3.3 The Client authorizes the Company to rely and act on any order, request,
                                    instruction or other communication given or made (or purporting to be given or made)
                                    by the Client or any person authorized on the Client’s behalf, without further
                                    inquiry on the part of the Company as to the authenticity, genuineness authority or
                                    identity of the person giving or purporting to give such order, request, instruction
                                    or other communication. The Client will be responsible for and will be bound by all
                                    obligations entered into or assumed by the Company on behalf of the Client in
                                    consequence of or in connection with such orders, requests, instructions or other
                                    communication.
                                </p>

                                <p>3.4 The Company reserves the right, but not obliged to the following: to set, at its
                                    absolute discretion, limits and/or parameters to control the Client’s ability to
                                    place orders or to restrict the terms on which a Transaction may be made. Such
                                    limits and/or parameters may be amended, increased, decreased, removed or added to
                                    by the Company.</p>

                                3.5 <h5>Arbitrage/cancellation of orders and transactions – </h5>
                                <p>The Company does not allow actions or non-actions based on arbitrage calculations or
                                    other methods that are based on exploitation of different systems or platforms
                                    malfunction, delay, error etc. The Company is entitled, by its own discretion, to
                                    cancel any transaction that has been executed due or in connection with an error,
                                    system malfunction, breach of the Agreement by Client etc. The Company’s records
                                    will serve as decisive evidence to the correct quotes in the world capital markets
                                    and the wrong quotes given to the Client; The Company is entitled to correct or
                                    cancel any trade based according to the correct quotes.
                                </p>

                                <h5>3.6 Cancel Feature Abuse</h5>
                                <p>Company offers a special cancellation feature that allows traders to cancel a trade
                                    within a few seconds of execution. Abuse of the cancellation feature can be
                                    considered market arbitrage and can result in forfeiture of profits. Company
                                    reserves the right to cancel a position if the cancellation feature is abused. The
                                    acceptable cancellation percentage cannot exceed 20% of the total number of executed
                                    trades. Cancelling more than 20% of the total number of executed trades is
                                    considered abuse of this feature and resulting profits may be forfeited from such
                                    abuse.</p>
                                <hr/>
                                <h4>4. Margin</h4>

                                <p>4.1 The Client may transfer funds to the Company with different methods of payment as
                                    permitted by the Company from time to time and in any currency (acceptable by the
                                    Company), and such funds will be converted and managed in the Trading Platform in US
                                    Dollars and/or Euro and/or GBP and/or CAD and/or AUD, as determined by the Company,
                                    according to an exchange rate determined by the Company’s according to the available
                                    market rates.
                                </p>

                                <p>4.2 When making a bank transfer, the Client must send the Company an authentic SWIFT
                                    confirmation, stating full bank account details and proof that the bank account is
                                    registered under its name. Non-delivery of the SWIFT confirmation or in case that
                                    the details do not conform to the Client’s details registered at the Company may
                                    result in the funds not being credited to the Client’s Trading Account.
                                </p>

                                <p>4.3 Whenever the Client transfers funds to the Company, those funds belong to the
                                    Company and will be treated by it as its own for the purpose of securing or covering
                                    the Client’s present, future, actual, contingent or prospective obligations, subject
                                    only to any contractual obligation of the Company to pay or return money to the
                                    Client according to the terms of this Agreement. The Client will not have a
                                    proprietary claim over money transferred to the Company, and the Company can deal
                                    with it in its own right. In determining the amount of collateral and the amount of
                                    the Company’s obligations to pay or return money to the Client, the Company may
                                    apply such methodology (including judgments as to the future movement of markets and
                                    values), as the Company considers appropriate.
                                </p>

                                    other Benefits the Client may be entitled to according to a specific agreement with
                                    the Company, shall be used as security to any Transaction, including Trading Losses,
                                    Commission and any other fee or debt owed by the Client to the Company, which will
                                    be automatically deducted from the Client’s equity in the Trading Account. The
                                    Client’s Funds shall not accumulate any interest or any other benefits. Trading in
                                    binary options that relate to a reference security shall not grant the Client any
                                    right to dividends, voting, allocations or any other Benefits, but may be subject to
                                    adjustments according to financial or corporate events which may have an effect the
                                    reference security, such as distribution of dividends, splits etc.</p>

                                <p>4.5 Repayment of any funds by the Company to the Client will be in the same currency
                                    and to the same account/credit card from which the funds were originally
                                    transferred, unless the Company has decided, by its own discretion, to return the
                                    funds to a different account of the Client.</p>

                                    derive from any criminal or other illegal activity and without any violation of any
                                    applicable anti money laundering laws and regulations.</p>

                                <p>
                                    4.7 The Client will have no claim against the Company and will not hold the Company
                                    responsible for any delay and/or differences originating from a credit company’s,

                        The Financial Products offered by the company include Contracts for Difference ('CFDs') and
                        other complex financial products. Trading CFDs carries a high level of risk since leverage can
                        work both to your advantage and disadvantage. As a result, CFDs may not be suitable for all
                        investors because it is possible to lose all of your invested capital. You should never invest
                        money that you cannot afford to lose. Before trading in the complex financial products offered,
                        please ensure to understand the risks involved.
